## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

### General

- What client-side validation is.
- How to implement basic form validation using JavaScript.
- How to handle form submissions and perform data validation using JavaScript.

## Requirements

### General

- Recommended editors: Visual Studio Code
- Ensure that all your files end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- You are not allowed to install, import, or use external libraries. This website must be built with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C Validator.
