ALX JavaScript Warm-up
Project badge

This project is part of the ALX curriculum and focuses on helping you get familiar with JavaScript. You will work on various tasks that involve basic scripting, working with variables, loops, functions, and more.

Background Context
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is used both for scripting and web front-end development. In this project, you will primarily focus on scripting to learn the fundamental concepts of JavaScript.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript programming.
Run JavaScript scripts.
Create variables and constants.
Differentiate between var, const, and let.
Work with various data types available in JavaScript.
Utilize control flow statements like if and if...else.
Use comments effectively.
Assign values to variables.
Implement loops such as while and for.
Use break and continue statements.
Define and use functions.
Comprehend variable scope.
Apply arithmetic operators.
Manipulate dictionaries.
Import external files.
Requirements
General
Recommended text editor: Visual Studio Code.
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
Ensure all your files end with a new line.
Create a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
Coding Style
Your code should adhere to the semistandard coding style (version 14.x.x), including rules from the Standard style and semicolons at the top.
Reference style guide: AirBnB style.
Installation
Install Node.js 14:

bash
Copy code
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
Install semistandard:

bash
Copy code
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
Tasks
Task 0: First constant, first print
Create a JavaScript script that prints "JavaScript is amazing."
Use a constant variable called myVar with the value "JavaScript is amazing."
Use console.log(...) to print the output.
Do not use var.
Task 1: 3 languages
Write a script that prints three lines:
"C is fun"
"Python is cool"
"JavaScript is amazing"
Use console.log(...) to print all the output.
Do not use var.
Task 2: Loop to languages
Write a script that prints the same three lines as Task 1 but using an array of strings and a loop.
Use console.log(...) to print all the output.
Do not use var.
Do not use any if/else statement.
Use only one console.log.
Implement a loop (e.g., while, for, etc.).
Task 3: Object
Update the provided script to replace the value 12 with 89.
Do not use var.
Task 4: Add file
Write a function that returns the addition of two integers.
The function must be visible from outside.
The function should be named add.
Do not use var.
Task 5: Const or not const
Create a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333.
Task 6: Call me Moby
Write a function that executes a given function x times.
The function must be visible from outside.
Prototype: function (x, theFunction)
Do not use var.
Task 7: Add me maybe
Write a function that increments and calls a given function.
The function must be visible from outside.
Prototype: function (number, theFunction)
Do not use var.
Task 8: Increment object
Update the provided script by adding a new function incr that increments the integer value.
Do not use var.
