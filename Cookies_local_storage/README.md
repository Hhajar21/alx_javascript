Project Overview
We're excited to explore the world of cookies and local storage in JavaScript. Throughout this project, you will complete a series of tasks that cover various aspects of working with cookies, including creating, reading, and deleting them. Additionally, you will experiment with local storage and session storage to build a shopping cart application.

Learning Objectives
By working on this project, you will:

Gain a deep understanding of how to create and manage cookies using JavaScript.
Learn how to set specific settings for cookies, such as expiration dates and paths.
Explore the differences between local storage and session storage in web browsers.
Develop practical skills in using JavaScript to manipulate cookies and web storage.
Requirements
Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and knowledge:

Recommended editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
All your files should end with a new line.
Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, and web development.
Node.js 14.x installed on your system.
Tasks
Task 0: Create Basic Cookie
Description: In this task, you will create a basic cookie using JavaScript. You will set up a simple HTML page with text inputs and buttons to create and display cookies.

Requirements:

Try to make your page look as close to the provided image as possible.
Use vanilla JavaScript to complete the task.
Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/0-index.html

Task 1: Create Cookie with Expiration Date and Specific Path
Description: In this task, you will extend the previous task by setting cookies to expire in 10 days and specifying their paths. You will modify the HTML page to achieve this.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/1-index.html

Task 2: Read Cookie
Description: In this task, you will create a function to read cookies in JavaScript. You will also update the display of cookies on the HTML page.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/2-index.html

Task 3: Delete Cookie and Mini Application
Description: In this task, you will build a mini application that allows users to log in and log out using cookies. You will create functions to show and hide a login form and manage user sessions.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/3-index.html

Task 4: Use js-cookie
Description: In this task, you will integrate the "js-cookie" library into your project to simplify cookie manipulation. You will replace your custom cookie functions with "js-cookie" functions.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/4-index.html

Task 5: Local Storage
Description: In this task, you will create a basic shopping cart application using local storage. You will manage available items and allow users to add items to their cart. The cart data will be stored in local storage.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/5-index.html

Task 6: Session Storage
Description: In this task, you will replace the use of local storage with session storage in the shopping cart application. This will ensure that cart data is session-specific and not persistent across browser sessions.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/6-index.html

Task 7: Advanced Use of Web Storage
Description: In this final task, you will build an advanced shopping cart system using session storage. You will manage available items, add items to the cart, and provide features to update and clear the cart.

Access your code with: http://localhost:8080/7-index.html

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub: GitHub Repository: alx_javascript

Install the required development environment by running the following command:

css
Copy code
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
Create an empty file named src/index.js.

Start the development server by running:

bash
Copy code
node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
Access each task by opening the corresponding HTML file in your browser using the provided URLs.

Project Structure
Task Files: Each task is associated with an HTML file (e.g., 0-index.html) containing the code and instructions for that task.
src/index.js: This file should stay empty; all JavaScript code for the tasks should be placed within <script> tags in the HTML files.
node_modules: Contains project dependencies, including webpack and webpack-dev-server.
