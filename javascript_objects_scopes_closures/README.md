ALX JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures
Project badge

This project is designed to help you understand JavaScript's object-oriented concepts, scopes, and closures. You will work on tasks that involve creating classes, defining object attributes, and implementing various methods.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

Understand the fundamental concepts of JavaScript programming.
Create and work with JavaScript objects.
Gain insights into the meaning of this and undefined.
Recognize the importance of variable types and scope.
Comprehend the concept of closures.
Explore object prototypes.
Learn how to inherit objects from one another.
Requirements
General
Recommended text editor: Visual Studio Code.
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
Ensure all your files end with a new line.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also, as a reference, adhere to the AirBnB style.
The length of your files will be tested using wc.
You are not allowed to use var.
Tasks
Task 0: Rectangle #0
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

You must use the class notation for defining your class.
Task 1: Rectangle #1
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

You must use the class notation for defining your class.
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
Task 2: Rectangle #2
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

You must use the class notation for defining your class.
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
Task 3: Rectangle #3
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

You must use the class notation for defining your class.
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.
Task 4: Rectangle #4
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

You must use the class notation for defining your class.
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h.
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w.
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h.
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X.
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.
Create an instance method called double() that multiplies the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.
Task 5: Square #0
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js.

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extend it.
The constructor must take 1 argument: size.
The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super()).
Task 6: Square #1
Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js.

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extend it.
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the square using the character c.
If c is undefined, use the character X.
