Project Overview
We're moving to Discord! In a few days, we will be leaving Slack in favor of Discord ðŸŽ‰. This project focuses on advanced JavaScript concepts to help you build a strong foundation in the language.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of the following JavaScript concepts:

Lexical scoping
Closure
Call stack
Binding
Callbacks
Requirements

Recommended code editor: Visual Studio Code
All your JavaScript files should use the .js extension.
Each task must be completed in its respective file within the project directory.
You must have a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
Task Descriptions
Here is a brief overview of the tasks in this project:

Lexical scoping and welcome message: Create a function that demonstrates lexical scoping and displays a welcome message.

Closure Scope Chain: Explore closures by creating nested functions and displaying messages.

Closure: Implement a closure-based function for displaying welcome messages.

Closure and Loops: Create a closure-based function to generate a list of student seat numbers.

Complex Closure: Use closures to create functions for division and addition.

Changing DOM with Closure: Modify the DOM based on different themes using closures.

Stack Order and setTimeout: Explore the JavaScript execution queue using setTimeout.

Getting Started
To run the code for each task, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository: alx_javascript.

Navigate to the relevant task's directory, e.g., Javascript_advanced/task-1.

Open the JavaScript file in a code editor.

Run the code in your browser's developer console or a JavaScript environment.

Observe the output and ensure that it meets the task requirements.

Feel free to explore each task and its corresponding file in the project directory. Happy coding!
